# Python Implementation of Essentials of Programming Languages

Made for the course [Comparative Programming Languages](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0S01AE.htm), which (in large part) 
bases itself upon the book [Essentials of Programming Languages](http://www.eopl3.com/).

Notes:

  - Not intended to be 'bootstrapped': the meta-language is the entirety of Python 3.7, not some limited subset of Scheme. However, I do 
try to reuse code where I can.

  - The CPL course diverges from EOPL at times

  - I may diverge from EOPL too, if I feel it's kinda stupid (like not introducing infix + and -)
